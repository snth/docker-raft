# docker raft

Emulate docker-compose CLI for Docker Swarm

Simply replace `docker compose up -d <service>` with `docker raft <service>`
in your deployment scripts. This command will deploy the service to run on your
docker swarm.

## Features

- ‚ú® Easily `exec` into containers running on remote nodes.
- üìú Easily tail logs of services running on remote nodes.
- üê≥ Deploy with the same environment variable substitutions as Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

You need to have an existing Docker Swarm set up and running. See the
[official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) for details.

## Installation

```bash
# Ensure directory for Docker cli plugins exists
mkdir -p ~/.docker/cli-plugins

# Download docker-rollout script to Docker cli plugins directory
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snth/docker-stack/main/docker-raft -o ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-raft

# Make the script executable
chmod +x ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-raft
```

Alternatively, you can use the provided install script for an interactively
guided install:

    bash <(curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snth/docker-stack/main/install)

## Usage

Run `docker raft -p <NAME> COMMAND` instead of 
`docker compose -p <NAME> COMMAND`.

Hopefully the rest is self-explanatory from there.

## FAQ

### Why the name docker-raft?

Initially I called it docker-stack but then I learned of the Docker cli-plugins
functionality and this created a name collision.

I considered a number of options like *skiff* (a type of Duck Boat), *flock*
(possible confusion with the flocker plugin), *ship* (implies more stability
than this deserves), ...

In the end I settled on *raft* because:

  - A raft is a janky, floating vessel which you probably wouldn't want to rely
	on for production use.
  - Docker Swarm uses the Raft consensus algorithm under the hood.
  - A [floating group of
	ducks](https://misfitanimals.com/ducks/what-is-a-group-of-ducks-called/#:~:text=Interesting%20Duck%20Facts-,A%20Raft%20of%20Ducks,-A%20raft%20of)
	is sometimes called a raft.
